## Easy
- https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/
- https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-two-elements-in-an-array/ 
	- here, extra details might not be useful at all 
- https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-less-than-k/
- https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/ 
	- interesting thing we have to keep swapping the element. when find one

## Medium
- https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array/
	- very good problem to solve, as the solution can be evolved from n^2 -> nlogn -> n with no extra space
	- also communicates that a problem can be solved in multiple ways
- https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/
	- challenging, teaches somewhat new approach like scaning the array backwords and forwards
