	1. You have a n^2 solutions, what is a way we can solve it in less time?


31-August
- Pivot element missing n solution


1st-Sept
- TwoSum, do it using binary search. 
- find duplicates, using binary search - no inbuilt 
- two sum, not a good solution. - no inbuilt
- subarray,  how to generate- using for index
- binary search iterative - algorithm

2nd-Sept
- where is the merging interval problem - https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/
- write a program which takes two sorted arrays and gives back a new array containing elements that are present in both of the input arrays. And there should not be any duplicates - [2,3,3,5,5,6,7,7,8,12] and [5,5,6,8,8,9,10,10] answer is [5,6,8]
- implement  finding duplicate using binary search 
- Pivot Index  ![[Pasted image 8.png]]
	- using 2 array ![[Pasted image 9.png]]
