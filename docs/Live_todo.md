https://app.mindmup.com/map/_free/2020/10/ceaf50900bee11eb9c50fd66bac808a5

- [x] why is this solution like this ? https://github.com/archana15/Algorithms/pull/17/files#diff-d879dd3373b16f375cbf758efe1c1627R65
	- [x] what is the thing that you actually learnt here
	- [x] what is the point of having a queue, what made you use that ?
	- [x] why not use a simple solution of recursivly counting the elements 
	- [x] BFS and what it means 
	- [ ] 

- [ ] What is BFS and how is that useful
- [x] Discuss about the even valued grand parent, and how that can improved
	- https://github.com/archana15/Algorithms/pull/17/files#diff-0b9b5377a01d8e42f385b8b1a34ab801R25 
	- Here the solution can be simplified, and given an example that i have
	- But the important concept there is, identifying that there is way we can track the parent and the grandparent

- [ ] Discuss binary tree, all node at distance k in a binary tree -https://leetcode.com/problems/all-nodes-distance-k-in-binary-tree/ 



11th- Oct
- [ ] Path sum - II, missing how to think about the problem
- [ ] Closest node to a given target in a binary search tree, (https://github.com/archana15/Algorithms/pull/17/files)
	- [ ] what is the complexity of this is the solution 
	- [ ] how can we do this better ?
		- [ ] are we using the fact that, the given input in a binary search tree ?
		- [ ] what is the property of a binary search tree.
- [ ] review how searching works in these three data structures
	- [ ] arrays
	- [ ] binary tree
	- [ ] binary search tree
