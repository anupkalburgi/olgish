## 3 - Find all Paths between Two Nodes

Implement a function that prints all paths that exist between two nodes (source to destination).

Input #
A graph, a source value, and a destination value
source = 0 destination = 5

Output #
A 2D list having all path

### 4 - Connected Components

Problem statement #
Implement a function that takes an undirected graph and prints all the connected components of a graph.

Input #
An undirected graph

Output #
All connected components in a graph in a list as a string

### 5 - Detect Cycle

The concept of loops or cycles is very common in graph theory. A cycle exists when you traverse the graph and come upon a vertex which has already been visited.

You have to implement the detect_cycle function which tells you whether or not a graph contains a cycle.

Input #
A graph

Output #
True if a cycle exists and False, if it doesnâ€™t
