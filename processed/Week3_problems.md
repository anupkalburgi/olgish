1. Let A[1..n] be an array if n distinct numbers. If `i < j` and `A[i]> A[j]` then the pair `(i, j)` is called an inversion  of A
	- List five inversions of array `(2,3,8,6,1)`
	- what array with elements from the set `{1,2,3 .... n}` has the most inversions
	- what is the relation between insertion sort running time and the number of inversions in an array, write justification
	- give an algorithm that determines the number of inversions in any 
	- permutations of `n` elements in a `0(nlgn)` time
