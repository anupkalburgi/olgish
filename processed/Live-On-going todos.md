- [x] why is this solution like this ? https://github.com/archana15/Algorithms/pull/17/files#diff-d879dd3373b16f375cbf758efe1c1627R65
	- [x] what is the thing that you actually learnt here
	- [x] what is the point of having a queue, what made you use that ?
	- [x] why not use a simple solution of recursivly counting the elements 
	- [x] BFS and what it means 
	- [ ]

	- Here the solution can be simplified, and given an example that i have
	- But the important concept there is, identifying that there is way we can track the parent and the grandparent
