- List of problems 
	- has very nice breakdown of problems one should be doing in graphs
	- https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/655708/Graph-For-Beginners-Problems-or-Pattern-or-Sample-Solutions

- BFS
	- Algorithms
	- implementations 
	- Shortest path of something
- DFS
	- Algorithm
	- implementation
	- longest possible path
- Union Find
- Are almost all problems based on of matrix or are these some that use python objects with pointers
- Finding cycled
- Dependency
- Topological Sorting - Dependency management
