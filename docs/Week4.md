### Day 1 (Aug 23)

# Searching, what is searching
### Why sorting
- Order is supposed to help with something. 
- makes it easy to process


### Binary Search 
- how can we use this in insertion sort, does it help at all, if that is helping how and where is it helping



## Think of a solution to a problem like this
Think of a solution for this for tomorrow,

Price = [100, 113, 110, 85, 105, 102, 86, 63, 81, 1010, 94, 106, 101, 79, 94, 90, 97]

How can u buy a share at lower price and sell at higher price and get profit, how can u maximize the profit


### Leet code
- buy once and sell once 
- 53 - Max Sub array
	- 24th Aug - No working solution
	- just generate all the sub arrays first, then worry about making the sum
	- 
- 169  - Majority number -
	- Got it using a dict, try doing it without dict
- 973 
	-  K closest
	- modify merge sort to compare the first element, 25th - Aug

- read list append and extend from python docs
- python generators - https://anandology.com/python-practice-book/iterators.html


Write Binary search Algo
Write a function that takes Array and Key and returns if  is present, and tell me the index
