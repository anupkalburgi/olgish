# Sorting

## Insertion Sort
We have covered this last week and we have solved some problems too.

---

### Merge Sort
#### Algorithm
There are two steps to the algorithm
1. Making the problem so small that, work i.e. in this case sorting becomes trivial
2. And then to combining these trivial problems to make a complete solution 

	Lets us fist understand, what it means to make a problem trivial, and what does that mean to combine the trivial answers. 
	
	
#### Analysis
- working and analysis

There are some clues we can use to determine what is the complexity of the algorithm. For example if we see a for loop within a for loop we it easily a n^2 algorithm, ex we had in insertion sort. But it can get trickey for other algorithms, but as we see more examples we get more hints likes that.

The unsettling thing about analysis is, we can drive something and say that is the answer. Also we can can assume something and prove that it holds for all the cases that ever exist. And

Recursion, think of where the base case is, when does the problem become too trivial to solve
