Problems
- there might be a issue with binary_tree/balanced_tree.py  
- https://github.com/archana15/Algorithms/pull/12/files#diff-7cdbac197b3e646b49775c47bfa006e5R94

- binary_tree/max_width.py 
	- what is missing here
	- we can do a bfs walk and measure the length of the array ?

- this is generally a bad idea, hard to keep track
- instead create nodes and then do left of right, may be this is easier for smaller problems but if the depth were to increase this might get hard
