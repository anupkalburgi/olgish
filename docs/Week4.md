### Day 1 (Aug 23)

# Searching, what is searching
### Why sorting
- Order is supposed to help with something. 
- makes it easy to process


### Binary Search 
- how can we use this in insertion sort, does it help at all, if that is helping how and where is it helping



## Think of a solution to a problem like this
Think of a solution for this for tomorrow,

Price = [100, 113, 110, 85, 105, 102, 86, 63, 81, 1010, 94, 106, 101, 79, 94, 90, 97]

How can u buy a share at lower price and sell at higher price and get profit, how can u maximize the profit
